# ONI Save Parser

The ONI Save Parser is a Kotlin/WASM web app service designed for
showing Oxygen Not Included (ONI) save games.

To read the save game files, it utilizes a Kotlin port
of RoboPhred's [oni-save-parser](https://github.com/RoboPhred/oni-save-parser).

It's only for reading and analyzing saves.
If you are looking for editing and saving files, please use [Duplicity](https://robophred.github.io/oni-duplicity/#/).

## Acknowledges

I would like to express my sincere appreciation to RoboPhred for developing
the original oni-save-parser and to Bryan Gonzalez for his C# port.
Additionally, special thanks are owed to [SGT_Imalas](https://github.com/Sgt-Imalas) for
providing valuable guidance on handling specialties in the save game files.
