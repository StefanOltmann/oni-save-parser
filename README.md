# ONI Save Parser

The ONI Save Parser is a Kotlin/WASM web app service designed for
showing save games in the game Oxygen Not Included (ONI).

To read the save game files, it utilizes a Kotlin port
of RoboPhred's [oni-save-parser](https://github.com/RoboPhred/oni-save-parser).

It's only for reading and analyzing saves.
If you are looking for editing and saving files, please use [Duplicity](https://robophred.github.io/oni-duplicity/#/).

## Special Thanks

I want to express my gratitude to RoboPhred for creating the original oni-save-parser.
Special thanks also go to Bryan Gonzalez for his C# port.
Both of these projects significantly contributed to my understanding of how the
game save files function.
